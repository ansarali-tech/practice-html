        <h1 id="bcc">Blockchain Computing</h1>
        Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions and maintains a 
        continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and 
        a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain.

        <h1 id="iot">Internet of Things</h1>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnectivity of physical devices, vehicles, 
        buildings, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity. 
        This connectivity allows these objects to collect and exchange data with each other and with humans, 
        creating a network of smart, connected devices.
