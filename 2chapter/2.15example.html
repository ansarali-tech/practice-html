        <h1>My Book</h1>
        <h2> Chapter 1</h2>
        <p> I was waiting in the reception at PIAIC. I saw there 
            <i>Dawn</i>,<i>jang</i> and other reading matria, as well as 
            <cite>Think and Grow Rich</cite>. It is a good book.
        </p>

        <p>
            I often think on the quote <q>Anyone who holds a true opinion
            without understanding it is like a blind man on a right road.</q> So <em>think and understand</em> it.
            I have soft copy of this book as a <abbr title="Portabe Document Format">PDF</abbr>. You must
            <strong>read</strong> this book.
